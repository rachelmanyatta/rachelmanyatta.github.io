<h2><i><strong>About my beliefs</i></strong></h2>
	<p>
		My name is Rachel Moses Manyatta, although most people would prefer addressing me as "The Optimist". As a high school student I took Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as my major subjects. My optimism towards the elimination of gender stereotypes is what motivated me to opt for these subjects.

	<h2><i><strong>About my achievements</strong></i></h2>
<p>

My belief is that a developed Africa is only possible once both genders are empowered. Since the females are the ones that suffer the most due to poverty in developing countries, women empowerment is inevitable. In order to assist my community in achieving this, I had created the "Woman Up" club at my school that dealt with empowering girls. The club helped them to be confident in giving out their opinions and views through the various debates that were conducted. It also funded women around the school campus with money that was used to help them start their own business and be independent. I also gave out public speeches on gender issues during morning assemblies just to create awareness to my fellow girls on how significant they are to our society most especially when they’re educated. Despite the gender stereotypes that I faced regarding my career, I did not give up.

<h2><i><strong>About my ambitions</h2></i></strong>

Not only do I want to be a software engineer in the near future, but also sponsor girls and women through the future "Woman Up" organization that ought to outgrow from the "Woman Up" club. Helping my fellow females make a difference in their communities has always been my unfading ambition.
